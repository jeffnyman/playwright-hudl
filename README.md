> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project contains a [DESIGN](DESIGN.md) document that talks about the design of the automation itself. There is also a [TESTING](TESTING.md) document that talks more about overall test strategy. You can see my "Principles of Coding" further down in this README.

> [!TIP]
> I also kept a relatively [atomic commit history](https://github.com/jeffnyman/playwright-hudl/commits/main/) to show how I built the project from scratch.

## üü¢ Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). The LTS version should be fine. You will also need the `npm` package manager, which comes with Node.js. A development environment or IDE with TypeScript/JavaScript support will help. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good choice.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

Clone the repository and then set everything up:

```sh
npm ci
```

The reason for `npm ci` is covered best in this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53325242).

Make sure to install the browsers that Playwright will need.

```sh
npx playwright install
```

Run the Hudl-specific tests:

```sh
npm run test:hudl
```

Check out the test report:

```sh
npm run test:report
```

## üíª Execution

In Playwright, a project is a logical group of tests that run using the same configuration. The sections below will each be shown with a command that executes the specific project. For any examples that are marked as UI, you can pass the `--headed` argument in order to see the browser execution.

You can run any Playwright tests using the [VS Code extension](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode) if you have it installed.

You can run all tests:

```sh
npm test
```

Below is a breakdown of test execution within the repository.

### üî∏ Hudl UI Tests

To run the Hudl UI tests, you can do this:

```sh
npx playwright test --project "Hudl Tests"
```

This project uses an `.env` file to set environment various for authentication. To run these tests, you will want to create an `.env` file in the root of the project directory. By design, the `.env` file is not version controlled.

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

Fill in the `HUDL_EMAIL`, `HUDL_PASSWORD` and `HUDL_DISPLAY_NAME` with your specific credentials.

### üî∏ Ludic UI Tests (EXTRA CREDIT)

I'm using my own site material for this. I have a sample article called [A Ludic Historian Pr√©cis](https://testerstories.com/xyzzy/ludic/article/precis.html).

The Ludic pages are simply designed as blog content pages. Their complexity comes in from how the header and the scroll-to-top functionality have dynamic aspects, in terms of how and when they display. The dark-light mode is a relatively simply implementation that also accounts for the system setting. There are two spec files here: one that uses a page object and the other that does not.

To run these tests:

```shell
npx playwright test --project "Ludic UI Tests"
```

### üî∏ Playground UI Tests (EXTRA CREDIT)

The application is here is my [Playwright Playwround](https://testerstories.com/xyzzy/). The playground area is designed to provide a simple landing page but then add some complexity. For example, the navigation pull out menu can have some challenges around checking for visibility and whether the widgets are in the viewport or not.

To run all the tests:

```shell
npx playwright test --project "Playground UI Tests"
```

The various pages within the playground are meant to run the gamut from relatively simple implementations of forms to slightly complex tables to elements that dynamically update but only upon the detection of certain user actions.

### üî∏ Tautology Tests

These tests do not use a browser at all. They are meant to showcase the idea of simply writing tests and having some general tautologies that validate the basic operation of the testing framework.

One of the tautology tests isn't entirely frivolous since it serves as a small API test as well. My [Swagger UI](https://testerstories.com/swagger-ui) is set up with some simple OpenAPI specs, one of which is my [tautology spec](https://testerstories.com/files/api/openapi_test.yml) which is run as part of this project.

```shell
npx playwright test --project "Tautology Tests"
```

Try running just the tests marked as `@canary`. You have to do this differently based on the operating system. For any POSIX-based system:

```shell
npx playwright test --project "Tautology Tests" --grep @canary
```

For Windows, particularly in Powershell:

```shell
npx playwright test --project "Tautology Tests" --grep "@canary"
```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Jeff's Principles of Coding

- Embrace small code.
- Abstraction encourages clarity.
- No computation is too small to be put into a helper function.
- No expression is too simple to be given a name.
- Small code is more easily seen to be obviously correct.
- Code that‚Äôs more obviously correct can be more easily composed.
- Be willing to trade elegance of design for practicality of implementation.
- Embrace brevity without sacrificing readability. Concise, not terse.
- Prefer elegance over efficiency where efficiency is less than critical.

These principles lean toward literate, intention-revealing code; code that is readable and maintainable without succumbing to over-engineering.

## üß¨ Code Quality

This project uses Prettier.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation-Prettier-f7ba3e.svg?logo=prettier" alt="Prettier"></a>
  <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Prettier-f7ba3e.svg?logo=github" alt="Prettier - GitHub"></a>
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/prettier"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/stackoverflow-Prettier-e87922.svg?logo=stackoverflow" alt="Prettier - Stack Overflow"></a>
</p>

This is critical for any automation-based project. To run Prettier and automatically fix any issues, you can do this:

```shell
npm run format
```

This project uses ESLint.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/latest/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation-ESLint-4b32c3.svg?logo=eslint" alt="ESLint"></a>

  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/eslint"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/stackoverflow-ESLint-e87922.svg?logo=stackoverflow" alt="ESLint - Stack Overflow"></a>
</p>

You can run linting in this project by doing this:

```shell
npm run lint
```

If you're feeling confident that the linter will be able to auto-fix your issue, you can run it like this:

```shell
npm run lint:fix
```

## üåÄ Pipeline

This project is using GitHub Actions. See [playwright.yml](https://github.com/jeffnyman/playwright-hudl/blob/main/.github/workflows/playwright.yml) and [lint.yml](https://github.com/jeffnyman/playwright-hudl/blob/main/.github/workflows/lint.yml).

## üê≥ Docker

To run tests in Docker containers using Docker Compose, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (included with Docker Desktop)

### Setup

1. **Create Environment File**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your test credentials:

```
HUDL_EMAIL=Your Email
HUDL_PASSWORD=Your Password
HUDL_DISPLAY_NAME=Your Display Name
```

2. **Build the Docker Image**

```sh
docker-compose build
```

### Running Tests

**Run only Hudl tests:**

```sh
docker-compose run --rm playwright npx playwright test --project="Hudl Tests"
```

**Run only UI tests (exclude tautology):**

```sh
docker-compose run --rm playwright npx playwright test tests/ui/
```

**Run all tests:**

```sh
docker-compose run --rm playwright npx playwright test
```

**Run a specific test file:**

```sh
docker-compose run --rm playwright npx playwright test authentication.spec.ts
```

**Run tests in headed mode (for debugging):**

```sh
docker-compose run --rm playwright npx playwright test --headed
```

**Run tests with custom reporter:**

```sh
docker-compose run --rm playwright npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

### Viewing Results

Test results and reports are automatically saved to your local `./results/` directory.

- `./results/` - Screenshots, videos, traces, and HTML reports
- `./results/results.json` - JSON test results
- `./results/results.xml` - JUnit XML results

To view the HTML report:

```sh
open ./results/index.html
# or on Linux: xdg-open ./results/index.html
```

### Development Workflow

**For active development, mount your local code:**

```sh
docker-compose run --rm -v $(pwd):/app playwright bash
```

This gives you an interactive shell where you can edit tests and see changes immediately, run individual commands, and debug test issues.

### Cleanup

Docker Compose automatically cleans up containers when using `--rm` flag. To remove the built image:

```sh
docker-compose down --rmi all
```

### Example Commands

```sh
# Build and run all tests
docker-compose build
docker-compose run --rm playwright npx playwright test

# Quick test run (rebuilds if needed)
docker-compose run --rm playwright npx playwright test

# Interactive debugging session
docker-compose run --rm -v $(pwd):/app playwright bash
```
