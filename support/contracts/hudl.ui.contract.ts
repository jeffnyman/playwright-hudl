/**
 * Centralized "UI contract" for Hudl authentication flows.
 *
 * Purpose:
 *  - Capture the expected UI texts, colors, and tokens that our tests rely on.
 *  - Avoid scattering hard-coded strings across multiple specs.
 *  - Make copy / style changes easier to update in one place.
 *
 * Think of this as the source of truth for what the UI should say/look like,
 * while the page objects define how to interact with it.
