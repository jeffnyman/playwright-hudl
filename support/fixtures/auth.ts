/**
 * Playwright fixture for creating an "already authenticated" browser context.
 *
 * Purpose:
 *  - Logs into Hudl once, saves the storage state (cookies, localStorage, etc).
 *  - Lets other test suites skip the login UI and start from an authenticated page.
 *  - Improves test speed and reduces duplication when authentication is *not* the feature under test.
 *
 * Relationship to my decision framework:
 *  - Stabilize phase: Prove login/logout flows directly (see authentication.spec.ts).
 *  - Sustain phase: Use this fixture in other specs to keep them focused and maintainable.
 *  - Scale phase: Reuse the saved storageState across browsers / CI shards for efficiency.
